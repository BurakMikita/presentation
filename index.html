				<section>
					A03:2021 – Injection
					<img data-src="./img/Injection_1.png" height="350" width="800" />

				<section>Injection - A hacker injects a query or
					command to insert data and forces the application to do something it was not designed to do.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Basic requirement to prevent</h4>
					<ul>

					management design”.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Basic requirement to prevent</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Limit resource consumption by a user or service..</li>
						<li>Create and use a library of safe design patterns or prebuilt components </li>

					A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
				</section>

				<section>Vulnerable and Outdated Components - outdated components refer to standard software that is
					used to support an application, but which has
					not been updated and is therefore at an “old” version known to contain vulnerabilities.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Basic requirement to prevent</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files.</li>
						<li>Only obtain components from official sources over secure links. </li>

			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures

					against integrity violations.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Basic requirement to prevent</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms</li>
						<li>Ensure libraries and dependencies,
							such as npm or Maven, are consuming trusted repositories. </li>

							configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the code</li>

					</ul>
				</section>
